# C-Chads Group Constitution

We are free software enthusiasts who enjoy writing code.

This group serves to collect repositories of code which are "interesting" or
"useful".

All code submitted must be free software.

if the code is not your own, it must contain any required attribution.

If you would like to join the C-Chads, submit an issue on this repository.

# Are there any rules about what I can post?

Nothing illegal, no non-free content.

As long as it is free and you have the right to give it, you can upload it.

Don't ruin someone else's work, make PRs to other peoples' repos, don't directly push.

# What does the group strive to collect?

Free software written in any/all languages, especially that which is useful or interesting.

Public domain code is a priority.

# Why do you fork other projects?

Preservation, show of interest. I (The author of this document and the founder, DMHSW) fork projects I think are useful or interesting into the C-Chads organization, as a sign of respect and interest.

Fork your own projects into the group if you like!

# What is the expectation for members?

None. We have a lot of inactive members, you can join just for kicks if that's your thing. The true OGs are the ones who contribute.

# Communication
We used to use discord to communicate, but due to concerns of it being an unethical platform (Child exploitation, primarily) we currently exclusively use Github.

You can email members or create discussions to communicate.

You can also make issues here.
