# C-Chads Group Constitution

We are free software enthusiasts who enjoy writing code.

This group serves to collect repositories of code which are "interesting" or
"useful".

All code submitted must be free software.

if the code is not your own, it must contain due attribution.

If you would like to join the C-Chads, submit an issue on this repository.

# Are there any rules about what I can post?

Nothing illegal, no non-free content.

As long as it is free and you have the right to give it, you can upload it.

Don't delete repositories.

# What does the group strive to collect?

C code, mostly. Good, quality C... but any language may be submitted.

# Why do you fork other projects?

Preservation, show of interest. I (The author of this document and the founder, DMHSW) fork projects I think are useful or interesting into the C-Chads organization, as a sign of respect and interest.

I also fork projects of my own into the C-Chads organization which I think are useful or mature enough to be interesting.

You may fork your own projects into the C-Chads organization which you think are mature and deserve to be shared.

# What is the expectation for members?

None. We have a lot of inactive members, you can join just for kicks if that's your thing. The true OGs are the ones who contribute.
