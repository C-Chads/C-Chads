"useful".

All code submitted must be free software.

if the code is not your own, it must contain due attribution.

If you would like to join the C-Chads, submit an issue on this repository.

# Are there any rules about what I can post?

Nothing illegal, no non-free content.

As long as it is free and you have the right to give it, you can upload it.

# What does the group strive to collect?

C code, mostly. Good, quality C... but any language may be submitted.
